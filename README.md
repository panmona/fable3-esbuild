# Fable4 Sample Project using esbuild

## Getting started
- Clone this repository to your local disk
- Run `yarn install` to pull all dependencies (This will also invoke `dotnet tool restore` to install dotnet dependencies)
- Run `yarn start` to build the project and start the dev server which will be available at `http://localhost:3000` 

Whenever you change an F# source file, it will update the dev server. You still need to manually reload the browser though.
